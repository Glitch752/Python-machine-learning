# Python-machine-learning

A few different machine learning projects made in python.

## Projects

### **Movie review classification**
A simple project I created that can decide if a movie review is positive or negative. I created this by following [this tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews?resource=download) and using [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews?resource=download).

### **Animal classification**
A simple project I made that can decide what animal is inside a picture. I used multiple sources to create this, but the main model training comes from [this tutorial](https://kapernikov.com/tutorial-image-classification-with-scikit-learn/). I used [this dataset](https://vcla.stat.ucla.edu/people/zhangzhang-si/HiT/exp5.html) to train the model.

I will also add more machine learning projects using other datasets as I continue to learn more about this subject.
