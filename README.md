# Python-machine-learning

A simple python machine learning project I created by following [this tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews?resource=download) and using [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews?resource=download).

I will also add more machine learning projects using other datasets as I continue to learn more about this subject.
